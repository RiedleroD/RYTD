_or Riedler YouTube Downloader_

RYTD is an automated music downloader, supporting [a few websites](http://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html). When you start it the first time, or pass the argument `--conf`, the configurator starts. It will let you configure your music folder, a unlimited amount of links to videos, files or playlists, and/or reset everything.
